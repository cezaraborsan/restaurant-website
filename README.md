# Japanese Restaurant Landing Page

This project is a landing page for a Japanese restaurant built using React. The design inspiration for this project came from a project available in the [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1200799657217214030/Food-Website).

## Motivation

I created this landing page as a way to practice my CSS skills and gain experience in React development. The goal was to replicate the design from the Figma project while adding my own touch and incorporating additional tech features.

## Features

- Responsive layout and design
- Navigation bar with menu links
- Menu page with tabs for different food categories
- Contact page with reservation information, opening hours, and catering details
- Main button to navigate to the menu page
- Footer with contact information and links

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with: `npm start`.
5. Open the application in your browser at: `http://localhost:3000`.

Feel free to modify the project to fit your own ideas and requirements.
